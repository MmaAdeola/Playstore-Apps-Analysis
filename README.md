# Playstore App Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description
This project was completed as a team effort by G.K. Jennifer, Uchanma Adeola Igbokwe, and Amul Gaurav. The goal of the project was to analyze and visualize data from the Google Playstore. It was undertaken as part of a live project organised by an organization named HiCounselor. HiCounselor is an organization that provides career acceleration by offering coaching and resources job seekers and professionals need to land their dream job.
